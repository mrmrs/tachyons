# TACHYONS

Functional css for humans.

## Principles
_"Do you want to write CSS or do you want to ship products?"_

* Everything should be 100% responsive
* Everything should be readable on any device
* Everything should be as fast as possible
* Designing in the browser should be easy
* It should be easy to change any interface or part of an interface without breaking any existing interfaces
* Doing one thing extremely well promotes reusability and reduces repetition
* Documentation helps promote reusability and shared knowledge
* Css shouldn't impede accessibility or the default functionality of Html
* You should send the smallest possible amount of code to the user

## Features

* Mobile-first architecture
* 8px baseline grid
* Multiple debugging utilities to reduce layout struggles
* Single-purpose class structure
* Optimized for maximum gzip compression
* Lightweight (~14kB)
* Usable across projects
* Growing open source component library
* Works well with plain html, react, ember, angular, rails, and more
* Infinitely nestable responsive grid system

## Hit the ground Running :runner::dash:

Copy this into an `index.html` file and open it in your browser.

```
Start composing interface components :rocket:

### Development


The CSS File is a sacred space. Single purpose classes should only be added to if the design system cannot handle it otherwise.

Classes should be small, pragmatic and reusable. Every added class adds to the size of the stylesheet.

### Local Setup

Clone the repo from github and install dependencies through npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons.git
cd tachyons
npm install
```

If you want to just use everything in tachyons/src as a jumping off point and
edit all the code yourself, you can compile all of your wonderful changes by
running

```npm start```

This will output both minified and unminified versions of the css to the css directory and watch the src directory for changes.
It's aliased to the command:

```npm run build:watch```

If you'd like to just build the css once without watching the src directory run

```npm run build```

If you want to check that a class hasn't been redefined or 'mutated' there is a linter to check that all of the classes have only been defined once. This can be useful if you are using another library or have written some of your own css and want to make sure there are no naming collisions. To do this run the command

```npm run mutations```

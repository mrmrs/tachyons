# tachyons-component-loader

Webpack loader for Tachyons html components in the Tachyons docs.

## Why?

This allows us to process components and their metadata at compile time, sending the minimal amount of metadata and content to the client.
It also allows components to be defined as simple html files and essentially self document themselves.

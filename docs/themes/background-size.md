# Background Size

`background-size` affects how background images fill their containing elements.
While measurements can be declared explicitly to size an image, the values that seem most reusable are contain and cover.

## Examples

### Contain

`contain` will make sure that the entire image is displayed within the element, regardless of the elements dimensions.

```.html
<div style="background-image: url(http://placekitten.com/g/500/500);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;"
     class="contain outline h4 w-50"></div>
```

### Cover

`cover` will make sure the entire element is covered - but wonâ€™t guarantee that the entire image will be shown.

```.html
<div style="background-image: url(http://placekitten.com/g/500/500);"
     class="cover outline h4 w-50"></div>
```

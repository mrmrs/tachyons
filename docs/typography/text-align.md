# Text Align

Designing for readability across infinite screen-sizes often times requires setting elements to have different text-alignments across breakpoints.

These are simple utilities for setting text-alignment to the left, right, or center of an element.

## Examples

```.html
<p class="tl measure bg-black-05">Aligned Left</p>
<p class="tr measure bg-black-05">Aligned Right</p>
<p class="tc measure bg-black-05">Aligned to the center</p>
<p class="tj measure bg-black-05 pa3">
  justifiedâ€”text is aligned along the left margin, and letter- and
  word-spacing is adjusted so that the text falls flush with both
  margins, also known as fully justified or full justification;
</p>
```

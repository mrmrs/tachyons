Here‚Äôs why I think designing systems with tools/frameworks like Tachyons is a Good Idea‚Ñ¢.

Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or scaling product) because new components/variants of a component are introduced.
Those variants sometimes (read: often) go undocumented, leading to duplication when that component/variant is needed (and created) again.
Even when the component is documented, documenting effectively often means dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.
Systems like Tachyons et al. approach this problem by instead documenting and limiting *properties* of components.
(I like to think of this as ‚Äúsubatomic‚Äù design.)

You then create components by composing subatomic components (properties).
Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply have a comprehensive list of ‚Äúingredient‚Äù subatomic components.
Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways to create hundreds of components.
The properties of those components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable values (our subatomic components).‚Äù

One of the comments I hear most frequently about Zarf‚Äôs design is ‚ÄòI love the minimalism!‚Äô Zarf‚Äôs minimalist experience is completely powered by Tachyons.
With Tachyons, I was able to build a product with a cohesive design story with minimal hassle and debugging.
Tachyons truly made developing the design for Zarf fun.

As a front-end developer turned full-stack developer, I appreciate maintainable and scalable front-end code, while having very little time to implement it myself.
Tachyons lets me achieve custom results designers are happy with without me having to spend too much time writing custom CSS.

Tachyons has seriously blown my mind.
Making landing pages responsive is now‚Ä¶ somehow‚Ä¶ actually fun?!

I used Tachyons for the first time on [goldenstaterecord.com](https://www.goldenstaterecord.com).
Really fast to make big changes to the design in-flight. üëç

Tachyons is powerful, obvious, and well documented. It‚Äôs made me rethink my approach to building organized and componentized CSS. I highly recommend you try it.
